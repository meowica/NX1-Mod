# NX1-Mod - Modification for Future Warfare (NX1)

## How to use (Xenia Canary)
### Patches
- Download the game [patches](https://github.com/Clippy95/game-patches/tree/NX1/patches) (I'll provide my own soon).
- Put them into `xenia\patches`.
- Make sure `apply_patches` is set to `true` in the Xenia config (It's `true` by default).
- Done.
### Plugins
- Make sure `allow_plugins` is set to `true` in the Xenia config (It's `false` by default).
- Download the latest `NX1-Mod.xex` and place it in into `xenia\plugins\4156089E\`.
- Place the `plugins.toml` there too, depending on the mode you want, `SP-Mod` for Campaign, `MP-Mod` for Multiplayer.
- Launch Xenia and load up Future Warfare (NX1).
- Done.
